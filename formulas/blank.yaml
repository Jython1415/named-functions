name: BLANK
version: 1.0.0

description: >
  Returns a truly blank cell value. This is useful in LAMBDA functions and MAP operations
  where you want to return blank cells rather than empty strings or other values.
  Equivalent to using the omitted argument syntax in IF (e.g., IF(condition, , value)),
  but more semantically clear and readable.

parameters: []

formula: |
  LAMBDA(input, )(0)
